        <h3>Welcome to baby's first web page</h3>

<p>Dear Rachel, Jamie, Cody, and Shaun:</p>

<p>Welcome to Addie's or Josie's very first digital presence!  Mary and I have registered <a href="http://AddiePorter.com">http://AddiePorter.com</a> and <a href="http://JosieEdwards.com">http://JosieEdwards.com</a> as a baby gift.  Why? What good is this?  Here are some ideas about how you can use this new cyber property:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Create a permanent email address.</b> Instead of relying on an email address like AddiePorter2014TheCutestBabyInTheWorld@gmail.com which is tied to Google (will they still be around in 50 years?), use Josie@JosieEdwards.com which can be forwarded to any email provider.</li>
	<li><b>Forward this domain</b> to a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://squarespace.com"SquareSpace</a> site, <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> blog, or a <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> page.  You can post your best photos or start a blog about her.</li>
	<li><b>Let her make her own birth announcement.</b>  Imagine grandma receiving an email from Addie@AddiePorter.com.</li>
	<li><b>Forward all your congratulatory messages.</b> Send to her email address all the notes you receive from your friends and family.</li>
	<li><b>Write her an email every week.</b> Think how much she would cherish those notes when she is 60.</li>
	<li><b>Create fun subdomains.</b> AddiePorter.com/week1, photos.JosieEdwards.com, or AddiePorter.com/firstbirthday.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does it work?  I registered the domains at <a href="http://hover.com">Hover</a> and can transfer them to you.  I've signed up for an email address too, but will need to forward it somewhere (gmail?).  Currently, both domains are pointing to a <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> site.  You could do the same although some of the other options might be easier for sharing photos etc.  Or, maybe you want to get her a github account now :-)  I'd be happy to help set up a blog or point the domain and email where you like.  One other note: I chose to use the nickname (Josie instead of Josephine).  If you think the formal name would be better, now is your one chance!</p>

<p>I hope you and your family and eventually your daughter enjoy this gift.  And maybe if we are all lucky, they will go into web development in 20 or so years :-)<p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>-- Mary and Clay</p>
